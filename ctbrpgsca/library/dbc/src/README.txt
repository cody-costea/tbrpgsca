The purpose of this project is to implement an open-source turn-based RPG combat
engine (similar to those found in various RPGs), and to offer a simple demonstration
of its capabilities. A full RPG is beyond the scope of this application, but it may
be used in more complex projects, compatible with its licenses.

Thank you for your interest.
