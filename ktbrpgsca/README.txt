The program includes graphic resources copyrighted by Reiner "Tiles" Prokein, which have been
released under the terms described at http://www.reinerstilesets.de/lizenz (and also in the
"Reiner's_Tilesets_License.txt" file).

The purpose of this project is to implement an open-source turn-based RPG combat engine (similar
to those found in various RPGs, such as "Final Fantasy" by Square Enix), and to offer a simple
demonstration of its capabilities. A full RPG is beyond the scope of this application, but it
may be used in more complex projects, compatible with its licenses.

Thank you for your interest.
