This application aims to implement a turn-based RPG combat engine, similar to those found in various RPG games, such as "Final Fantasy" by Square Enix. This is actually the first Android application I programmed on my own initiative, and I began doing it to improve my skills with Java and the Android SDK. Perhaps someday I'll use it in a larger RPG project.

Thank you for your interest.
